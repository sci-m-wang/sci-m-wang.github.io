### T-COL
T-COL is a counterfactual explanation generation method. It utilizes a link tree structure to select several local feature subsets through a partitioning strategy, which are eventually stitched together into a counterfactual interpretation.

### PICA
Although traditional language models play a good role in giving help, there is a problem of emotional participation deficiency, since long suggestive replies are against the goal of empathy. To solve the problem, we put forward the multi-turn dialogue model PICA, a chatbot that can empathize and rely on the emotion required.
