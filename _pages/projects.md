## Specific Works

### T-COL
T-COL is a counterfactual explanation generation method. It utilizes a link tree structure to select several local feature subsets through a partitioning strategy, which are eventually stitched together into a counterfactual interpretation.

### MM-Bigbench
MM-BigBench, with a range of diverse metrics to thoroughly evaluate different models and instructions, including the Best Performance metric, the Mean Relative Gain metric, the Stability metric, and the Adaptability metric.

### PICA
Although traditional language models play a good role in giving help, there is a problem of emotional participation deficiency, since long suggestive replies are against the goal of empathy. To solve the problem, we put forward the multi-turn dialogue model PICA, a chatbot that can empathize and rely on the emotion required.
